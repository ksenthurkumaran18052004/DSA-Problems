Q) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Explanantion:m
You donâ€™t need to find the global min first.
Instead, as you iterate:
  Keep track of the minimum price so far
  At each step, calculate potential profit = current price - min price
  Keep track of the maximum profit so far


class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n= prices.length;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max_profit= 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(prices[i]<min){
                min=prices[i];
            }
            else if ((prices[i]-min) > max_profit){
                max_profit = (prices[i]-min);
            }
        }
        
        return max_profit;
    }
}
